[View the webpage](https://chlarson74.github.io/refactor-homework/)

The project is a refactoring of a web page. The Search Engine Optimization techinques utilized are begining level. The web page is built and commented to bring the original files closer to best practices.

Work completed:
- reduced the pixel density of the provided images to 72ppi for faster page load speed.
- website title tag has a concise description
- semantic header tag / header placed at the begining of the html tags in logical order / header has intro content and nav links within a sequential order
- replaced the div element used for a background image with an img tag with an alt attribute
- semantic article tag / article tag placed after header to begin website content in logical order
- semantic aside tag for sidebar content placed in logical order
- semantic section tag / section tag nested inside article tag to divide website content in logical order
- alt tag added to img tags
- semantic footer tag / placed at the end of the HTML content in logical order
- combined repeated css attributes into single element hooks to simplify stylesheet
- removed unecessary classes to target the semantic tags for: header, article, section, aside, footer


## Usage 

Webpage deployed online is accessible through a web browser like Google Chrome.


## Learning Points 

- Semantic HTML is important for Search Engines to fully understand each part of our webpage. They provide more context than a generic div tag.
- Smaller image files will keep you website running fast and light. It is important to break down those 300 dpi images into 72 ppi image for the web.
- simplified code is clean and easier for humans and machines to read. The code is simplified to combine redundant styles and remove unnecessary classes.
